    <string name="info_text">📖 How to Play Snake\n\n
        The snake moves automatically when the game starts.\n\n
        👉 Control the movement by swiping your finger across the screen:\n
        - Swipe right → snake moves right\n
        - Swipe left → snake moves left\n
        - Swipe up → snake moves up\n
        - Swipe down → snake moves down\n\n
        ⏸️ Tap the II button in the top right corner to pause the game.\n\n
        In the pause menu, you can choose:\n
        - Resume – continue playing\n
        - Main Menu – return to the main menu\n
        - Exit – quit the game\n\n
        🧱 Walls: the play area has solid edges – if the snake hits a wall, the game ends.\n\n
        🐍 Snake and its body:\n
        - Eating fruit makes the snake grow and earns you points.\n
        - If the snake crosses itself, it bites its own tail → it shortens and your score decreases.\n\n
        🎯 Game objective: collect food to make the snake grow and score points, but avoid walls and its own body!\n</string>
